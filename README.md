# THE KEYS AT QUINTA

## Project objective
This website was created to highlight the ongoing issues
with the european economy by showing an example of a  
building project that despite being in one of the most 
expensive area's to buy still failed.

## Live Site

View website [Here.](https://pt-70.github.io/The-Keys-at-Quinta/)

## UX

This project centered on a simple, responsive design 
that should be familiar and intuitive to the user.
Set over four pages with various elements available to view 
on different screen sizes it should provide the user with a 
good UX!

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to set out the general look and 
feel of the site and is available in this repository.

## Features

The navbar is set on all but one of the pages, and in this page
a scroll to top button has been added to bring the user back to
the navbar.

The opening page has a background image of the development with
a text box overlay to the left which includes a link to more 
information about the area, and has a promotional video set to the right.
The video doesn't render on mobile as it looked cluttered.

The second page has a background image of an aerial shot of the area,
and in keeping with the first page a text box to the left and this time 
 google maps to the right with a marker to point out the area. Hovering
 over the marker reveals an instruction to zoom in and look at the 
 satellite image.
 The map doesn't render on mobile as it looked cluttered.

Page three has a similar layout of background image and navbar, but this
time has full width scrolling overlay images of the development in a state
of disrepair. There is sufficient padding between these images to view the
set background image. Boxes of text have been added in this area giving the
user some more detail. Amongst this text is a link to Wikipedia for more 
information. A scroll to top button has been applied to this page which appears
after you scroll past the first page.

 The final page returns to a similar layout as the first two which the user
 will be familiar with. A large text box which includes a final external link to
 a local property site to the left and an image to the right.
