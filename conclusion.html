    With the bank being owed €279 million and the development seemingly so close to completion why pull the plug?
    The developer claimed the end value would be in the region of €400 million and had deposits of some €7.5 million 
    resulting in sales revenue of €40 million.
    However it has been reported that of that, television stars Ant & Dec and Philip Schofield alone had lost just under
     €7 million between them. This would leave €33 million of properties with no apparent deposits to speak of! 
     And how much more money would it take to complete? Then in today's changing markets it's doubtful they would achieve 
     anything like the valuations of the developer. Quinta itself has no shortage of multi million Euro <a href="https://www.quintaproperty.com/algarve/" target="_blank">properties</a> to choose from
     and most make 'The Keys' look overpriced at best.
    What happens to it now? Will another developer be appointed to finish it? Will the bank cut their losses and move it on to 
    another developer? Would another developer take it on? 
    It seems an incredible waste to let it lie and deteriorate every day as it has for some three years now, and the longer it 
    sits the worse it gets, possibly until a point where it's no longer feesable to complete. At the moment though it remains a 
    sorry looking ghost town like so many of it's Spanish counterparts that are in a similar situation from the global recession 
    of the mid noughties.
